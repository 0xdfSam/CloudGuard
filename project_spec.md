# Automated Vulnerability Scanner for Cloud Services

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Python-based tool for detecting misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in cloud environments, with a focus on reducing false positives and providing actionable remediation steps. The scanner will integrate with multiple cloud services, starting with AWS and Azure, and will align findings with industry-standard frameworks for better prioritization.

## Key Features
1. **Multi-Cloud Scanning**: Detect vulnerabilities across AWS, Azure, and potentially GCP.
2. **Misconfiguration Detection**: Identify common security issues such as:
   - Exposed storage buckets (S3, Azure Blob)
   - Insecure API configurations
   - Excessive permissions
   - Unencrypted data at rest
   - Insecure network configurations
3. **Framework Alignment**: Map findings to:
   - CWE Top 25
   - MITRE ATT&CK framework
4. **False Positive Reduction**: Integrate directly with cloud APIs for context-aware scanning.
5. **Prioritized Remediation**: Provide actionable remediation steps based on severity.
6. **Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports with visualizations.

## Technical Requirements
1. **Programming Language**: Python 3.9+
2. **Cloud Service APIs**:
   - AWS SDK (boto3)
   - Azure SDK
3. **Security Frameworks**:
   - CWE Top 25 mapping
   - MITRE ATT&CK mapping
4. **Authentication**: Secure credential management
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for adding new scanning capabilities
6. **Performance**: Efficient scanning of large cloud environments

## Target Metrics
- 40% reduction in false positives compared to traditional vulnerability scanners
- Comprehensive coverage of the OWASP Top 10 for Cloud
- Performance benchmark: Complete scan of moderate-sized environment in under 30 minutes

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core architecture and AWS S3 bucket scanning
2. **Phase 2**: Azure Blob storage and API scanning
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced policy checking and framework alignment
4. **Phase 4**: Reporting and remediation guidance
5. **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and false positive reduction

## Dependencies
- Python libraries for cloud SDKs
- Security framework databases
- Authentication and encryption libraries
- Reporting and visualization tools

## Challenges and Considerations
- Maintaining up-to-date security checks as cloud services evolve
- Balancing thoroughness with performance
- Managing secure access to cloud environments
- Handling cross-cloud service dependencies
